	<description>The Medical Overhaul project brought to you with all the hard work by the Modders of the Rimworld Modding Collaborative. The Medical Overhaul Project fundamentally changes how the Rimworld medical system works, Gone are the days of pawns Instantly dying during combat, and gone are the days that injuries can be healed with a simple patch up from herbal medicine The Medical overhaul project gives pawns a chance to survive, but at a cost. Pawn can be stabilized with everything from live support systems, to Intubation tubes, to CPR and Defibrillators, But it will come sometimes at a lasting cost to the pawns health. The Medical Overhaul project Adds Over 20 new medications that can be administered for treatment of the multiple new injuries that pawns can suffer, 3 New crafting tables, Multiple plants, the ability to run Intravenous (IV) fluids in the field and have stands back at the hospital running Medications to heal up a pawn quicker, And extensive amount of medical procedures. We all hope you enjoy the amount of hard work that has gone into the project and we hope it becomes a "must need" mod for you!  </description>
